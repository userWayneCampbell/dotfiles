# dotfiles
Dotfiles are used with my fork of dwm and slock.

install_list is a list of commands to run to have my selected packages.

All color schemes are solarized and created for Arch. (I used arch btw)


### Install

For installation of my dotfiles use the following command to use GNU stow to
symbolically link my dotfiles to your HOME directory.
>sh stow.sh
