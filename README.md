# dotfiles
Dotfiles are used with my fork of dwm, slock, and slstatus.

Common software used: vim, tig, ranger, tmux, weechat, gnome-terminal, alsamixer, hack-font, slock, dwm, slstatus, nmcli (with my custom fish functions), and plexamp.

All color schemes are solarized and created for Fedora Release 28.
